# What is Katsuniya

Katsuniya is a game and a novel I'm currently working on.

The novel is going to have the logic attached to the game.

# Why Katsuniya?

Unknown, but still thinking

# Where does this work?

This build is mainly focused on Windows.

The Mac and Mobile interface will come into play when I want to begin learning Java and Swift.

# What's the structure of the game?

It's a Rhythm based game that requires you to listen to the song playing in order to be able to play.

The concept is still a W-I-P but I'll be updating this when the general idea has arrived.

Players require precision and time in order to get the overall idea of the game.

You can easily get lost in the game if you don't listen to the song

Light notes will be added when more releases come up.
