# What is Katsuniya

Katsuniya is a game and a novel I'm currently working on.

The novel is going to have the logic attached to the game.

# Why Katsuniya?

Unknown, but still thinking

# Where does this work?

This build is mainly focused on Windows.

The Mac and Mobile interface will come into play when I want to begin learning Java and Swift.

# What's the structure of the game?

It's a Rhythm based game that requires you to listen to the song playing in order to be able to play.

The concept is still a W-I-P but I'll be updating this when the general idea has arrived.
